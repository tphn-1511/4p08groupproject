Our research topic is social anxiety and the purpose of this project is to examine how first-year Brock students’ self-esteem, social ties, friendship quality, and technology usage in university can predict their level of social anxiety in their fourth year. The data is provided by Brock Health Youth Project. We then present our findings to a party of interest: Brock Counselling Services. What students experience in their first year can significantly affect their time in university, therefore having data about how students’ social anxiety changes throughout their time at Brock could help Brock Counselling Services come up with different ways to help these students.
